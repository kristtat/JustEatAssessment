# Just Eat Complete at Home Coding Assignment

This project was completed as part of the recruitment process for the Just Eat Early Careers Software Engineering Program. It aims to use the API provided by Just Eat to find restaurant data and return it on the console. The project aims to use the API to send a postcode to return the below filtered data:
● Name
● Cuisines
● Rating - as a number
● Address


# How to build, compile and run my solution 


# Assumptions or things that were not clear to me

I had never worked with APIs prior to being sent the assessment. In order to be able to complete the assessment, I watched a freeCodeCamp tutorial on how to work with APIs, and one with Coding with John. I also tested the API through Boomerang. 
-assumed we were to use starRating rather than userRating for ratings as userRatings appeared empty
-assumed we were to print address as Street, City, Postcode

# Improvements I would make make to my solution
Although, not meriting extra points, I am quite keen to learn how to return the project on a a web interface as this is new to me.
