# Just Eat Complete at Home Coding Assignment

This project was completed as part of the recruitment process for the Just Eat Early Careers Software Engineering Program. It aims to use the API provided by Just Eat to find restaurant data and return it on the console. The project aims to use the API to send a postcode to return the below filtered data:
● Name
● Cuisines
● Rating - as a number
● Address


# How to build, compile and run my solution 
IDE: I am not very familiar with how to clone the file from Git, but it is possible to run the file through and IDE like Eclipse. For this, you can copy + paste the code into a file titled Restaurant.java. 

Command line: To compile and execute from the command line you can copy + paste the code into a file titled Restaurant.java. Once this is done, the file can be compiled by navigating into the folder with the file and typing 'javac Restaurant.java'. Once the file has been compiled, it can be executed with the command 'java Restaurant'.

In order to make the programme work, a GSON JAR file needs to be installed on the computer executing the programme.

# Assumptions or things that were not clear to me
 
-I assumed we were to use starRating rather than userRating for ratings as userRatings appeared empty.
-I assumed we were to print address as Street, City, Postcode for the address.
-I listed all restaurants in order they were in the JSON file, rather than for example in an alphabetical order, or by highest rating, as no specific order was stated.
-I 

# Improvements I would make make to my solution
-I did not know how to improve the listing of the cuisines to include 'Halal', and not a comma in the end, this is something I would like to improve on
-I have never used APIs before and as such the code is quite long and clunky, I would like to practice more on how to make the code more sleek.
Although, not meriting extra points, I am quite keen to learn how to return the project on a a web interface as this is new to me.
